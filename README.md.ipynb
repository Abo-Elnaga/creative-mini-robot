    "# ü§ñ Mini Logic-Based Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a creative mini robot project built using only basic hardware components ‚Äî no microcontrollers or programming involved. The robot moves randomly when powered, and the structure is designed using concepts from dynamics, trigonometry, and geometry.\n",

    "##  Project Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a combination of simple tools and solid engineering knowledge can lead to a functional and artistic robotic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot uses:\n",
    "- Logic-based movement (no code)\n",
    "- Aesthetically calculated body shape\n",
    "- Controlled power flow to drive random motion\n",
